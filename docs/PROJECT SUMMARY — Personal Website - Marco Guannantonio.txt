# ✅ **PROJECT SUMMARY — Personal Website for Dr.-Ing. Marco Giannantonio**

You built a **Next.js 14 + Tailwind + Framer Motion** personal branding website for a Mercedes-Benz HV Battery Project Lead, with a **corporate, dark, Mercedes-inspired UI** and a subtle **game-like interactive dashboard**.

---

## **Technical Setup Completed**

* Next.js 14 App Router project created inside `C:\marco-site`
* Tailwind configured with custom Mercedes-style tokens
  (`body`, `surface`, `accent`, `text-muted`, etc.)
* Globals cleaned (no `theme()` calls)
* Layout shell created with:

  * dark luxury background
  * centered 6xl container
  * subtle ambient glow
  * branded MG monogram
* Installed and configured:

  * **Framer Motion** (animations)
  * **Lucide Icons** (optional later)

## **Homepage (page.tsx) Features**

### **1. Interactive Dashboard**

* Right side contains 4 modules:

  * HV Battery Strategy
  * eDrive & Powertrain Architecture
  * Simulation & Data Analytics
  * Leadership & Coordination
* Hover highlights the module
* Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) cycle between modules
* **Enter** scrolls to *Focus Areas*
* Framer Motion animations:

  * scale
  * border emphasis
  * background glow

### **2. Smooth Scrolling Navigation**

* Header nav: Overview, Experience, Focus Areas, Research, Contact
* Clicking each or pressing Enter scrolls smoothly to the target section

### **3. Ultra-Corporate Mercedes UI**

* All typography muted/clean
* Section titles uppercase with tracking
* Border lines subtle, no gimmicks
* Dark background with minimal highlight color
* Tailwind classes everywhere

---

## **4. Content Sections Added**

Each section is implemented as placeholder text, ready for real content:

* **Overview**
  Executive summary (placeholder)
* **Experience**
  Timeline layout with cards
* **Focus Areas**
  Expanded detail for all modules
* **Research & PhD**
  Title + placeholder text
* **Contact**
  UI-only form with Name, Company, Email, Message, Send button

---

## **5. Code Status**

* `page.tsx` is now a **client component**
* Uses `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`
* Clean, valid TypeScript
* `npm run dev` compiles with no errors

---

Implemented full contact form backend using a Next.js App Router API route at /api/contact.

Added validation, structured JSON responses, and integrated Resend for email delivery.

Configured RESEND_API_KEY and added controlled form fields, loading states, and success/error handling in page.tsx.

Fixed domain-related Resend sending issue by switching to Option 2 (proper domain verification).

Prepared DNS instructions (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX) for the domain provider.

Added SEO polish: complete metadata, structured data (JSON-LD Person schema), and social preview configuration.

Created and integrated a premium Open Graph image using the existing Mercedes concept car asset (mercedes-eqx-grill).

Updated layout.tsx to reference /og-image.png for both Open Graph and Twitter cards.

Verified that contact API behavior is correct (503 when email service is not configured, 200 once domain + API key are ready).

This completes the email pipeline, SEO, structured data, and social media branding phase of the site.
